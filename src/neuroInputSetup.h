 * Purpose: Allows the user to change the movement keys. There is a contract
 *          between the WheelChair Controller and the Neuro-Headset
 *          that the inputs will be the same between the two devices. So, any
 *          changes here by a user would need to be altered in the controller
 *          setup as well.
